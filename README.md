## District Summary 
using the len/count function and unique- to count the number of uniques schools
using the len/count function to count the total number of students 
using the sum function to calculate the total budget 
using the mean function to calculate the average math score 
using the mean function to calculate the average reading score 
calculate the percentage of math scores that are above 70 using count the fuction then using the float function to the calculate the total number of students
calculate the percentage of reading scores that are above 70 using count the fuction then using the float function to the calculate the total number of students
calculate the overall percentage of reading and math scores that are above 70 using count the fuction then using the float function to the calculate the total number of students
using pandas and then the list function to make a summary table for total number students, budget, avg math score and reading score, % of passing and reading and overall 

## School Summary 
using the size and groupby function to calculate the the total number of students per school
using the index and join function to calculate the total budget 
to calculate the per capita use the budget per school and divide it by the total number of students 
using groupby and mean to calculate the avg of math scores
using groupby and mean to calulate the avg of read scores 
to calulate how many students have passed is to first establish which math score is more 70 and then to use a groupby and size to summarize per school(same process for reading and overall passing rate)
using pandas and list function to calculate the per student budget and school as well as average 

## Highest-Performing Schools/Bottom Performing Schools
using the sort function to calculate the highest and bottom performing 
ascending as false for highest 
ascending as true for lowest 

## Math Scores and Reading Scores 
using groupby and mean to calculate the mean math score for each grade 
using the pandas dataframe function to make a summary table of each grade and its score 
change to reading for the reading grades 

## Scores by School Spending/School Size 
the first step is to establish the bins(as in the spending as bins) 
then create a copy of the summary table for the bins
using pandas and dataframe to create a summary of the per school captia, and spending in the bins as well as the labels(conditional for each bin)
using a groupby and mean to calculate the average math/reading/passing score for math and reading for each bin 
using pandas and dataframe to create a summary table 
*same steps now for the size for the bins 

## Scores by School Type 
using groupby and mean to calculate the average of math/reading and passing grade for each one 
and the dataframe and pandas to summarize by district
